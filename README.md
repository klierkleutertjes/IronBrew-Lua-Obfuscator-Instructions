# Lua-Obfuscator

A Lua Obfuscator made for Roblox, but should work on most Lua applications

## Setup Instructions

1. Install [IronBrew Install Package for Windows](https://download1486.mediafire.com/l1n42gkz3cag/s86r45frx7sgpag/IronBrew+Obfuscate.zip)
2. UnZip the Zip file with an tool like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html?&L=16)
3. Open the 2 Setup files to download Lua 5.0 and DotNet RunTime 2.0
4. And you're ready to obfuscate!

## Usage

1. Put your script in **Script.lua**
2. Open **run.bat**
3. Look in **Out.lua** for your obfuscated script

## Information
